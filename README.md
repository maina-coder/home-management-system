## Features

- SQLite database to store data persistently.

## How It Works

1. When you run the Python file, you're asked to enter a username and password.
2. Upon successful login (`username: mercy`, `password: password`), the system displays a menu.
3. Users can manage residents, visitors, and expenses through the menu.
